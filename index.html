<p>We live in the Information Age, which has bourne information systems and internet communication that have evolved economies, societies and cultures.

<p>It is difficult to overstate the value of Information and Information Systems to people, companies, organisations and governments. As with all valuable assets, there is a significant risk that threats to such assets are realised through vulnerabilities being exploited.

<p>Our aim is to equip you with knowledge of the major principles of cyber security in order to better manage security risks by putting in place security controls that reduce the likelihood and impact of breaches of information security.
